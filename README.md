## About The Project

<img src="./public/Screenshot_20241028-180105.jpg" alt="Dashboard screenshot" width="400" />
<br/>

ExpenBoard is an intuitive expense tracking application designed to simplify personal financial management by allowing users to seamlessly record, monitor, and analyze their spending. Built with Next.js, ExpenBoard offers a dynamic and responsive user experience, perfect for managing your budget, reviewing spending trends, and generating transaction reports. Itâ€™s especially crafted to make budgeting and financial planning easier through clean, organized data representation.

## Built With

ExpenBoard is built using NextJs

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org)
- [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/)
- [Mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [BunJS](https://bun.sh/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" >Git</a> is a distributed version control system used for software development. It allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, keeping track of changes and managing versions. It also enables users to revert changes and collaborate more effectively.

<a href="https://bun.sh/">BunJS</a> is a JavaScript runtime, package manager, test runner and bundler built from scratch using the Zig programming language. It was designed by Jarred Sumner as a drop-in replacement for Node.js. Bun uses WebKit's JavaScriptCore as the JavaScript engine, unlike Node.js and Deno, which both use V8.
